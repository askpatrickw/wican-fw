# üöó Vehicle Support Overview

WiCAN **vehicle profiles** are available for various models listed below. These profiles include **vehicle-specific parameters**‚Äîespecially for **electric vehicles**‚Äîbut also occasionally for **standard (non-electric)** models (e.g., **odometer readings**, **fuel levels**).

In most **electric, hybrid, and standard vehicles**, a set of **standard OBD-II PIDs** is supported‚Äîbut the availability of these PIDs depends on the **make and model**:

- Some manufacturers **disable certain standard PIDs**.
- Others **override or replace** them with **proprietary, manufacturer-specific PIDs**.
- For this reason, even vehicles from the same brand can offer **different data access**.

You can try scanning available **standard PIDs** using the **Automate** tab:
